# Employee Schedule Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the modifications made to the employee management system to improve DTR (Daily Time Record) calculations and make schedule management more intuitive.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Migration**: `2025_08_08_051700_add_day_schedule_to_employees_table.php`
- **New Field**: Added `day_schedule` enum field to `employees` table
- **Options**: 
  - `monday_friday` (5 days) - Default
  - `monday_saturday` (6 days)
  - `monday_sunday` (7 days)
  - `tuesday_saturday` (6 days)
  - `sunday_thursday` (5 days)
  - `custom` (for future customization)

### 2. Model Updates
- **File**: `app/Models/Employee.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `day_schedule` to `$fillable` array
  - Added helper methods for DTR calculations:
    - `getWorkingDaysPerWeek()` - Returns number of working days per week
    - `getDayScheduleDisplayAttribute()` - Human-readable format
    - `getWorkingDaysForMonth($year, $month)` - Calculate working days for a specific month
    - `isWorkingDay(\Carbon\Carbon $date)` - Check if a date is a working day
    - `getExpectedHoursPerDay()` - Get expected daily hours based on schedule
    - `getExpectedHoursForPeriod($start, $end)` - Calculate expected hours for a period

### 3. Form Updates

#### Employee Create Form (`resources/views/employees/create.blade.php`)
- **Changed**: "Work Schedule" → "Time Schedule"
- **Changed**: "Pay Schedule" → "Pay Frequency"
- **Added**: New "Day Schedule" field with dropdown options
- **Enhancement**: Added helpful descriptions for each field

#### Employee Edit Form (`resources/views/employees/edit.blade.php`)
- **Changed**: "Work Schedule" → "Time Schedule"
- **Changed**: "Pay Schedule" → "Pay Frequency"
- **Added**: New "Day Schedule" field with dropdown options
- **Enhancement**: Added helpful descriptions for each field

#### Employee Show View (`resources/views/employees/show.blade.php`)
- **Changed**: "Work Schedule" → "Time Schedule"
- **Added**: "Day Schedule" display using the new accessor method

### 4. Controller Updates
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `day_schedule` validation rules in both `store()` and `update()` methods
  - Validation ensures only valid enum values are accepted

## Benefits

### For DTR Calculations
1. **Accurate Working Day Calculation**: The system now knows exactly which days an employee should be working
2. **Flexible Schedules**: Support for various working patterns (5-day, 6-day, 7-day weeks)
3. **Automated Calculations**: Helper methods make it easy to calculate expected vs actual working hours
4. **Period-based Analysis**: Can calculate expected hours for any date range

### For User Experience
1. **Clearer Labels**: 
   - "Work Schedule" → "Time Schedule" (clarifies it's about shift timing)
   - "Pay Schedule" → "Pay Frequency" (clarifies how often they get paid)
2. **Better Context**: Added descriptive text for each field
3. **Comprehensive Information**: Day Schedule provides clear working days information

### For HR Management
1. **Better Planning**: HR can easily see employee working patterns
2. **Accurate Reporting**: DTR reports will be more precise based on actual working schedules
3. **Compliance**: Helps ensure labor law compliance with working day regulations

## Usage Examples

### Get Working Days for Current Month
```php
$employee = Employee::find(1);
$workingDays = $employee->getWorkingDaysForMonth(2025, 8);
echo "Employee has {$workingDays} working days this month";
```

### Check if Today is Working Day
```php
$isWorkingToday = $employee->isWorkingDay(now());
echo $isWorkingToday ? "Today is a working day" : "Today is a rest day";
```

### Calculate Expected Hours for Pay Period
```php
$startDate = Carbon::parse('2025-08-01');
$endDate = Carbon::parse('2025-08-15');
$expectedHours = $employee->getExpectedHoursForPeriod($startDate, $endDate);
echo "Expected hours for this period: {$expectedHours}";
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Day Schedules**: Implement custom working patterns for employees with irregular schedules
2. **Holiday Integration**: Factor in company holidays when calculating working days
3. **Shift Differentials**: Apply different rates based on day schedules
4. **Automated DTR Validation**: Use day schedules to automatically validate DTR entries
5. **Dashboard Analytics**: Show working day analytics and patterns in admin dashboard

## Technical Notes

- The migration includes proper rollback functionality
- All existing employees will default to `monday_friday` schedule
- The enum values are validated at both database and application levels
- Helper methods use Carbon for accurate date calculations
- The changes are backward compatible with existing DTR systems
