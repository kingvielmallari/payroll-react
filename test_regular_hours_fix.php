echo "PayrollController Enhanced - Regular Hours Fix\n";
echo "============================================\n\n";

echo "✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "   - Previous implementation was summing regular_hours from ALL day types\n";
echo "   - This included: regular_workday, holidays, rest_days, etc.\n";
echo "   - Should only capture basic/regular workday hours for 'regular_hours' field\n\n";

echo "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "   - Added time breakdown calculation in createPayrollSnapshots method\n";
echo "   - Extracts hours by log_type (regular_workday, holidays, rest_day, etc.)\n";
echo "   - Uses only 'regular_workday' hours for snapshot 'regular_hours' field\n";
echo "   - Separates regular and overtime hours for each day type\n\n";

echo "✅ CHANGES MADE:\n";
echo "   1. Added time breakdown calculation by day type\n";
echo "   2. Extract regular_workday hours separately:\n";
echo "      - regularWorkdayHours = only regular hours from regular workdays\n";
echo "      - regularWorkdayOvertimeHours = only overtime hours from regular workdays\n";
echo "   3. Updated snapshot creation:\n";
echo "      - 'regular_hours' = regularWorkdayHours (not total from all types)\n";
echo "      - 'overtime_hours' = regularWorkdayOvertimeHours (not total from all types)\n";
echo "      - 'holiday_hours' = totalHolidayHours (calculated separately)\n";
echo "   4. Added detailed logging for debugging\n\n";

echo "✅ EXPECTED RESULT:\n";
echo "   - 'regular_hours' in payroll_snapshots will now show only basic workday hours\n";
echo "   - If an employee worked 24 regular hours on regular workdays,\n";
echo "     the snapshot will show regular_hours = 24 (not sum of all day types)\n";
echo "   - Holiday hours, rest day hours will be tracked separately\n\n";

echo "✅ TESTING STEPS:\n";
echo "   1. Create a draft payroll with mixed day types (regular, holiday, rest)\n";
echo "   2. Submit the payroll for processing\n";
echo "   3. Check the payroll_snapshots table:\n";
echo "      - regular_hours should show only regular workday hours\n";
echo "      - holiday_hours should show total holiday hours\n";
echo "   4. Check the application logs for detailed breakdown\n\n";

echo "Implementation complete! Ready for testing.\n";
