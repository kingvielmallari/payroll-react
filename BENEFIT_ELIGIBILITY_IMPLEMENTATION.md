# Benefit Eligibility Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature allows system administrators to control which employees receive specific settings (deductions, taxes, allowances, bonuses, and paid leave) based on their benefit status (with benefits or without benefits).

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `benefit_eligibility` ENUM field to three settings tables:
  - `deduction_tax_settings`
  - `allowance_bonus_settings` 
  - `paid_leave_settings`
- Possible values: `both`, `with_benefits`, `without_benefits`
- Default value: `both`

### 2. Model Updates
Updated three models with:
- Added `benefit_eligibility` to `$fillable` arrays
- Added `appliesTo($employee)` method to check if setting applies to specific employee
- Added `forBenefitStatus($benefitStatus)` scope for filtering settings

**Models Updated:**
- `app/Models/DeductionTaxSetting.php`
- `app/Models/AllowanceBonusSetting.php`
- `app/Models/PaidLeaveSetting.php`

### 3. Controller Updates
Updated validation rules in all settings controllers:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Settings/DeductionTaxSettingController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Settings/AllowanceBonusSettingController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Settings/PaidLeaveSettingController.php`

Added validation rule: `'benefit_eligibility' => 'required|in:both,with_benefits,without_benefits'`

### 4. PayrollController Updates
Updated payroll calculation logic to filter settings based on employee benefit status:
- `calculateDeductions()` method now uses `forBenefitStatus()` scope
- `calculateAllowances()` method now uses `forBenefitStatus()` scope
- `calculateBonuses()` method now uses `forBenefitStatus()` scope

### 5. View Updates
Updated forms to include benefit eligibility selection:

**Deduction Forms:**
- `resources/views/settings/deductions/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/settings/deductions/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/settings/deductions/index.blade.php` (added display column)

**Allowance Forms:**
- `resources/views/settings/allowances/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/settings/allowances/edit.blade.php`

### 6. Migration
Created migration: `2025_08_11_005138_add_benefit_eligibility_to_settings_tables.php`

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Government Deductions Only for Employees with Benefits
Set SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG deductions to `benefit_eligibility = 'with_benefits'`
- Employees with `benefits_status = 'with_benefits'` will have these deductions
- Employees with `benefits_status = 'without_benefits'` will not have these deductions

### Scenario 2: Allowances for All Employees
Set allowances to `benefit_eligibility = 'both'`
- All employees receive these allowances regardless of benefit status

### Scenario 3: Special Bonus Only for Employees Without Benefits
Set special bonus to `benefit_eligibility = 'without_benefits'`
- Only employees with `benefits_status = 'without_benefits'` receive this bonus

## Benefits

1. **Flexible Configuration**: Admins can precisely control which employees receive which benefits
2. **Compliance**: Helps ensure proper application of government mandated deductions based on employment type
3. **Cost Control**: Allows targeted application of allowances and bonuses
4. **Automated Processing**: Payroll calculations automatically apply the correct settings based on employee benefit status

## User Interface

The settings forms now include a "Apply To" dropdown with three options:
- **Both (With Benefits & Without Benefits)** - Default, applies to all employees
- **Only Employees With Benefits** - Only applies to employees with benefit status 'with_benefits'
- **Only Employees Without Benefits** - Only applies to employees with benefit status 'without_benefits'

The settings index pages display the benefit eligibility as color-coded badges for easy identification.
