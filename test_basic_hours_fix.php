// Verification script for BASIC column hours display fix

echo "BASIC Column Hours Display Fix\n";
echo "=============================\n\n";

echo "✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "   - BASIC column showing '0.0 hrs' instead of '24.0 hrs'\n";
echo "   - Processing payroll had snapshot with regular_hours = 24.00\n";
echo "   - View was using timeBreakdowns instead of snapshot data\n\n";

echo "✅ ROOT CAUSE:\n";
echo "   - show.blade.php was using timeBreakdowns for both draft and processing payrolls\n";
echo "   - For processing/approved payrolls, should use static snapshot data\n";
echo "   - timeBreakdowns may not be fully available for processing payrolls\n\n";

echo "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "   - Updated show.blade.php around line 460-470\n";
echo "   - For DRAFT payrolls: Use timeBreakdowns (dynamic calculation)\n";
echo "   - For PROCESSING/APPROVED payrolls: Use snapshot data\n";
echo "     • basicRegularHours = detail->regular_hours (from snapshot)\n";
echo "     • basicOvertimeHours = detail->overtime_hours (from snapshot)\n\n";

echo "✅ LOGIC CHANGE:\n";
echo "   Before:\n";
echo "   - Always use timeBreakdowns['regular_workday']['regular_hours']\n\n";
echo "   After:\n";
echo "   - DRAFT: Use timeBreakdowns['regular_workday']['regular_hours']\n";
echo "   - PROCESSING: Use detail->regular_hours (snapshot data)\n\n";

echo "✅ EXPECTED RESULT:\n";
echo "   - BASIC column should now show '24.0 hrs' from the snapshot\n";
echo "   - This matches the 24.00 value in payroll_snapshots.regular_hours\n";
echo "   - Hours display will be consistent with saved snapshot data\n\n";

echo "✅ TESTING:\n";
echo "   1. View cache has been cleared\n";
echo "   2. Refresh the payroll page\n";
echo "   3. BASIC column should now show '24.0 hrs' instead of '0.0 hrs'\n";
echo "   4. Amount should still show correct value from snapshot\n\n";

echo "Fix applied and ready for testing!\n";
